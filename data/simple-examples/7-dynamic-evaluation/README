Example how to invoke dynamic evaluation of the model during testing, and combination of
static and dynamic models. Note that dynamic evaluation of the model is somewhat similar
to cache models - recent words have increased probability. Useful mostly for perplexity
experiments.

For adaptation for speech recognition (or machine translation) experiments, use -one-iter
and retrain models in one pass on the 1-bests, with 0.1 learning rate. If the test data
contain independent topics, it is preferable to adapt main model to each of them separately.
